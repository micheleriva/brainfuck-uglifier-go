# ðŸ’© Brainfuck Uglifier

A Brainfuck optimizer which removes useless spaces, comments and useless characters from your Brainfuck program.

I know this is pretty useless, but I am trying some new programming languages and this is a really simple task to replicate across all the programming languages that I am currently testing.

# Usage

```sh
$ go run main.go <path/to/your/brainfuck/program.bf>
```

this will write for you an ugly `optimized.bf` file in your current working directory.
